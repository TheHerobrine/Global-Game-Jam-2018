# How to build the game

This game was created using Unity 2017.2.1f1. To be able to build it, one simply needs to launch Unity at the location of this README. The Unity part of this project was developed entirely under Windows, as such, any Mac OS user may or may not succeed to build the project. The build should be performed as a normal Windows build in the Build windows of Unity.

# How to play the game

Echoes is meant to be play in pair. One of the players will be a young child, while the other will be some sort of whisp, following the player around. The child can see the world surrounding him and interact with it, but the whisp only have sounds of the surrounding space. To represent this, a player should have the controls of the game and access on the screen, while the other (the whisp) should wear headphones and ideally not see the game.
